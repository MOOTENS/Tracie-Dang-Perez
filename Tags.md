The ability to encapsulate one of your main strengths in one word is amazing. Mine is the word POWERFUL.

Why think about your strengths?
Why voice it out into the universe?
Why do this in the first place?

To voice out your strengths gives you more energy and motivation to know you have what it takes to accomplish the deed or goal in front of you. I know one of my strengths is being POWERFUL because I know my mind is powerful and it pushes me to stand up for myself and to know when to be vulnerable and compassionate as well. I feel powerful to show off my body and to show my vulnerable side because this gives me more strength to be more confident in my own skin. I voice this out to make it one of my mantras to live a more fulfilled life. To truly be happy with my body. To truly be happy with my health.
What is one of your strengths in one word? Make it real and tell me loves ðŸ’‹ðŸ–¤

I AM continuing to take care of my mental, physical, and spiritual self! You see, it is all about your MINDSET on how you talk about yourself and to accomplish the goals you want to do. Instead of saying I will NOT, why not say I AM?

Why am I not happy with my health?
Why am I not at my ideal weight?
Why am I not feeling good with my self?
And the list goes on... I much rather want to say:
I AM healthy because I strive to be mentally, physically and spiritually.
I AM at my ideal weight because I continue to work on eating healthy, exercising, and being active in life.
I AM happy with myself because this is my face, my ethnicity, my spirit and my body which is my sanctuary.
If you start saying the positive traits of what you ARE, this is a huge motivation to push you to improve and become what you want to be. Don't compare to others. Start working and improving on what you want to become yourself! Be a better person than what you were yesterday ðŸ’‹ðŸ–¤
