The ability to encapsulate one of your main strengths in one word is amazing. Mine is the word POWERFUL.

Why think about your strengths?
Why voice it out into the universe?
Why do this in the first place?

To voice out your strengths gives you more energy and motivation to know you have what it takes to accomplish the deed or goal in front of you. I know one of my strengths is being POWERFUL because I know my mind is powerful and it pushes me to stand up for myself and to know when to be vulnerable and compassionate as well. I feel powerful to show off my body and to show my vulnerable side because this gives me more strength to be more confident in my own skin. I voice this out to make it one of my mantras to live a more fulfilled life. To truly be happy with my body. To truly be happy with my health.
What is one of your strengths in one word? Make it real and tell me loves üíãüñ§

I AM continuing to take care of my mental, physical, and spiritual self! You see, it is all about your MINDSET on how you talk about yourself and to accomplish the goals you want to do. Instead of saying I will NOT, why not say I AM?

Why am I not happy with my health?
Why am I not at my ideal weight?
Why am I not feeling good with my self?
And the list goes on... I much rather want to say:
I AM healthy because I strive to be mentally, physically and spiritually.
I AM at my ideal weight because I continue to work on eating healthy, exercising, and being active in life.
I AM happy with myself because this is my face, my ethnicity, my spirit and my body which is my sanctuary.
If you start saying the positive traits of what you ARE, this is a huge motivation to push you to improve and become what you want to be. Don't compare to others. Start working and improving on what you want to become yourself! Be a better person than what you were yesterday üíãüñ§

When posing for boudoir it is definitely a different type of posing compared to commercial and print work. It is all about your body shape, the sexiness, the styling, the expressions and the intimacy. It is not so much about the clothing like print and commercial work. Both boudoir and commercial and print modeling has its challenges but that is the fun of it ‚ù§

Would you ever do boudoir modeling?
What is your favorite style of modeling?
What type of modeling are you comfortable with?

Yes it is good to model within your comfort zone but it is GREAT to be uncomfortable and try something new too üíãüñ§

Let's talk about Model Comp Cards!

A lot people ask me the following:

What type of pictures would you need?
What info should be on it?
What style of pictures?

Ultimately as a model it is great to have a wide variety of images ranging different styles from print, commercial, fashion, etc. I was signed to be both a Model and an Actress with different agencies so having a wide range of images really helps! Usually your comp card would also include digitals as well so it should always be updated including updating your sizes üòä

Like I stated in my previous video (if you have not seen it), do NOT be discouraged thinking height is a factor for being a professional model! As long as you have confidence, courage, hard work, and consistency to keep applying yourself you will get there! Plus sorry for my face being cut off in the last scene of the video! Lol üíãüñ§
