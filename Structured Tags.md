The ability to encapsulate one of your main strengths in one word is amazing. Mine is the word POWERFUL.

Why think about your strengths?
Why voice it out into the universe?
Why do this in the first place?

To voice out your strengths gives you more energy and motivation to know you have what it takes to accomplish the deed or goal in front of you. I know one of my strengths is being POWERFUL because I know my mind is powerful and it pushes me to stand up for myself and to know when to be vulnerable and compassionate as well. I feel powerful to show off my body and to show my vulnerable side because this gives me more strength to be more confident in my own skin. I voice this out to make it one of my mantras to live a more fulfilled life. To truly be happy with my body. To truly be happy with my health.
What is one of your strengths in one word? Make it real and tell me loves 💋🖤



I AM continuing to take care of my mental, physical, and spiritual self! You see, it is all about your MINDSET on how you talk about yourself and to accomplish the goals you want to do. Instead of saying I will NOT, why not say I AM?

Why am I not happy with my health?
Why am I not at my ideal weight?
Why am I not feeling good with my self?
And the list goes on... I much rather want to say:
I AM healthy because I strive to be mentally, physically and spiritually.
I AM at my ideal weight because I continue to work on eating healthy, exercising, and being active in life.
I AM happy with myself because this is my face, my ethnicity, my spirit and my body which is my sanctuary.
If you start saying the positive traits of what you ARE, this is a huge motivation to push you to improve and become what you want to be. Don't compare to others. Start working and improving on what you want to become yourself! Be a better person than what you were yesterday 💋🖤





When posing for boudoir it is definitely a different type of posing compared to commercial and print work. It is all about your body shape, the sexiness, the styling, the expressions and the intimacy. It is not so much about the clothing like print and commercial work. Both boudoir and commercial and print modeling has its challenges but that is the fun of it ❤

Would you ever do boudoir modeling?
What is your favorite style of modeling?
What type of modeling are you comfortable with?

Yes it is good to model within your comfort zone but it is GREAT to be uncomfortable and try something new too 💋🖤


Let's talk about Model Comp Cards!

A lot people ask me the following:

What type of pictures would you need?
What info should be on it?
What style of pictures?

Ultimately as a model it is great to have a wide variety of images ranging different styles from print, commercial, fashion, etc. I was signed to be both a Model and an Actress with different agencies so having a wide range of images really helps! Usually your comp card would also include digitals as well so it should always be updated including updating your sizes 😊

Like I stated in my previous video (if you have not seen it), do NOT be discouraged thinking height is a factor for being a professional model! As long as you have confidence, courage, hard work, and consistency to keep applying yourself you will get there! Plus sorry for my face being cut off in the last scene of the video! Lol 💋🖤


So one of the biggest challenges and necessary things Models have to learn is to know about posing! You may probably have questions like the following:

How do I know what to pose?
How do I pose full body?
How do I pose for head shot?
What expressions do I show?

And the list goes on... For me, practice definitely makes perfect and it is so important to learn your angles of your body and face! I have been modeling and acting for 5 years now professionally and I am signed with a few agencies in SF, Sacramento, Arizona, and Toronto, Canada. This was not an easy walk in the park to work hard on face expressions, body angles and shape. I always make sure to give my 100% on every shoot and definitely provide a transparent communication between you and the photographer!
It is important to always do just subtle movements, soft hands, light fingertips, and to definitely create a nice S shape with your body! For acting is a whole other ball game but I will get into that next time 😊
In the beginning of the video I was posing upper body actually using more subtle movements with my hands around my face. Later in the video I am doing more 3/4 and full body poses during the shoot which I provided more S shape and use more of my arms. I am still changing it up but with subtle movements. Even though I am short this does not stop me from modeling!

For more questions and dialogue, let's chat more about it in the comments! Thank you everyone 💋🖤


Train your Mindset

It is so important to put your head in the game when you have goals and you are fighting for your missions. It is even harder to train your mindset to be disciplined and hardworking literally on a DAILY basis to make everything work especially as an entrepreneur or independently working for yourself. Keep fighting and keep grinding.

Yes I finally got into that @tiktok game and it is pretty fun! Lol my username is pretty much the same as my Instagram 🤣 who has a @tiktok account out there?! Let's connect! 💋🖤


I am very grateful for all of the growth, support, and connections we are obtaining via our business @mootensproductions ❤ I know I have been talking about this nonstop but this journey is changing our lives for the better and I am excited for the future to come! So far this has not been an easy path but I know this is what George and I are meant to do and to live our lives to the fullest as entrepreneurs. Always reach higher and never stop learning 💋🖤


I am grateful to try @dewycel_official Eye Cream Plus for the first time! It is very smooth and moisturizes the skin which also can be used for the whole face and well! It contains coconut oil, meadowfoam seed oil, and shea butter. It also has skin protein of the 5 peptide complex to help improve tired skin texture and restore healthy skin. It is also certified by KFDA for having the synergy effect of adenosine and peptide which are wrinkle-reducing substances. Definitely check them out on Amazon! 💋🖤

Let's tackle life with 100% of everything you have! Why wait on pursuing your goals, your dreams, your milestones or on living!? Life is meant to be lived not meant to be safe. Is being stagnant really living? Jump and take those risks, be optimistic, be bold, grow, learn, and be fierce 🔥


Everything is in the details 🌟 This is also our go-to pose (in the 1st image) apparently for George and I when we model together lmao 🤣


New year, great start, and a new beginning for George and I working our business 100%! You can follow our new business page @mootensproductions 💋 We appreciate all of your support and love! ❤🖤❤



One of the sweetest things George has said was he would have the first image of me tattooed to his chest lol I told him that would be very painful though haha 🤣 I am still in LOVE with this shoot! Just wait for the cuteness in the last photo in the album ❤🖤❤



I feel happy playing the grand piano again at my parents house playing a Prelude that I do not remember what it is called but I know it's by composer Dennis Alexander. It's crazy how time flies. I will start playing the piano more often again because it makes me happy 🎶🎼🎹 Happy Holidays everyone! ❄❤❄❤


The snow and I are one as George and I are one ❄ This was so magical eloping in the snow with Jennelle! I am glad to have a trip like this together ❤ Happy Holidays everyone! ❤❄❤❄❤

I am very grateful and honored to model for this Limoncello-Inspired Italian Summer Styled Wedding Shoot where we were featured in @weddingchicks! 💋🖤 This set got me reminiscing the warmer sunny days contrast to this colder weather 🌼☀️


I was honored to model for the beautiful new launch of @graffitiglammed "Be Out Of This World" Lash Collection by the talented @graffitima 💋🖤 .

Another whole outfit representing recycled fashion from @freestyleclothingexchange and @boheme.threads 💋
I chose to do my part living a more sustainable lifestyle by:
1) continuing to wear recycled fashion to help reduce the gas emissions from factories processing new clothing
2) using reusable straws
3) using reusable bags
4) recycling
5) composting
6) using organic, natural and cruelty-free beauty and hair products with recyclable bottles
7) using organic, natural and cruelty-free laundry detergent with recyclable bottles
8) using organic, natural and cruelty-free cleaners with recyclable bottles
9) planting some of our own plants and vegetables and more! My next big goal is to eventually get an all electric car like the Tesla 😈
Let's live a more mindful and sustainable lifestyle by helping our planet one step at a time 🌱

I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday break! I sure had a wonderful time with my loved ones ❤🖤❤

Seize the fucking day because you are all worth it ⚡Plus my whole outfit is literally ALL sustainable fashion and I am proud of it! 😈💋🖤


The situations we go through in life shapes us to react and act a certain way. Some of those experiences are more traumatic than others. Sometimes we feel anger, sadness, anxiety, pain, guilt, discomfort, or stress. Sometimes we feel "jaded" from those traumatic experiences. Thus, this project interprets how we can deal with the jade that may affect our lives unproductively -- we slash it down and move on 😈


Yay I am a parts model now with my tiny hands! Lol This was a fun commercial we shot for @tapwith.us alongside with other wonderful talents I met on set via @modelsinctalentagency ! It was a lot of fun 📽


I am very grateful to continue to meet and create with more talented people each day and I am always pushing myself to learn and do more on a daily basis. Stagnation is pain so I always lead myself into uncomfortable situations to grow. Learning enough is nonexistent as it is a continuous cycle throughout life. Stay grinding my friends! 💋🖤



I had a great time shooting with a great team recently! So excited to show you guys some cool action packed video work soon! Here is a BTS video of me posing which was shot by the talented @ptenfilms while the awesome @glyde1der and @natural_nicholas were snapping photos 🖤


Plus I will post a YouTube video soon on how I prepare for creative shoots with a team! Stay tuned 💋🖤



I am serious about how great the @evianspray is super refreshing! Just look at the second picture to see how "serious" I am lol 💋🖤 #evianspray #sponsored #ad .


You are 100% in control of your own life. Yes there will be situations when it is out of your control and chaos breaks loose but it is 100% up to you on how you deal with it and to keep going. Everyone keep grinding and keep hustling 💪


What does spirituality mean you? I truly believe all of us are connected and are the same no matter how different we look and act and no matter how different our social-economic is, we need to all take care of each other all over the world. We are all still living in the same planet. Laws and policies, climate change, poverty, and epidemics effects us directly and indirectly as a domino effect. Thus judge less, listen more, and show love. This is part of my spirituality. What's yours?
